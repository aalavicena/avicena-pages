Hi there! Welcome to my website.

My name is Wei Zhang (张巍). You can hear how to pronounce my name [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP1FfWhdXTc).

I am currently a PhD candidate in Economics at Purdue University. My research lies at the intersection of econometrics and macroeconomics, with a focus on dynamic factor models and large Bayesian VARs. I’m particularly interested in how these tools can be used for forecasting, structural analysis, business cycle monitoring, and tackling missing data challenges in high-dimensional datasets.

Before Purdue, I completed my master’s degree at Humboldt University of Berlin, where I focused on causal inference under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Bernd Fitzenberger. My master’s thesis used China’s 1998 college enrollment expansion as an instrument to estimate the effects of education on the wage distribution in urban areas via instrumental quantile regression.

I expect to graduate in August 2025. After that, I’m thrilled to be joining Domenico Giannone on a set of exciting research projects that push the frontier of empirical macroeconomics.

Outside of research, I love creative pursuits like painting and playing the piano. I’m also an avid hiker — many of my best research ideas have come to me while on the trail. Feel free to check out [this link] for a few snapshots from my state park adventures!
