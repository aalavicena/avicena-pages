Hi there! Welcome to my website.

My name is Naufal Rahman Avicena, and I am from Indonesia.

I am finishing my Master's in ecology at the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences (XTBG). My research covers the intersection between human-wildlife conflict (HWC) and AI. I'm particularly interested in how state-of-the-art methods can be used to understand HWC and how it can inform evidence-based conflict mitigation. I am currently studying under the tutelage of Prof. [Ahimsa Campos-Arceiz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cup55xsAAAAJ&hl=en). My master's thesis used human casualties occurrence data from 10 countries (2000-2023) to model the drivers and predict the risk of elephant-caused human casualties across Tropical Asia using spatial regression techniques.

Before XTBG, I obtained my BSc (Hons) in the First Class from the University of Nottingham Malaysia. My Final Year Project (FYP) used elephant vocalizations collected from Sri Lanka and Malaysia to train an AI model that could detect elephant sounds. Some notable publications stemmed from this project (please see Research section). Subsequently, I worked at the university as a Research Associate after my graduation to lead the human-elephant conflict early warning systems project. I was fortunate to have studied under the tutelage of Dr. [Ee Phin Wong](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/expertiseguide/geography/dr-ee-phin-wong.aspx) and Prof. [Tomas Maul](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ckZuLUgAAAAJ&hl=en) during this period

<!-- From 2015 to 2017, I studied causal inference at Humboldt University of Berlin under the supervision of Prof. Bernd Fitzenberger. My master’s thesis used China’s 1998 college enrollment expansion as an instrument to estimate the effects of education on the urban wage distribution through instrumental quantile regression. -->

Outside of research, I enjoyed playing football, running, and reading books. Playing as an attacking winger requires me to constantly scan the field and deduce the best ways to penetrate the opponents' defense. It taught me the value of being composed under constant pressure and resilience to continue improving myself. I read a wide range of genres, but have special fondness towards Indonesian literature.
