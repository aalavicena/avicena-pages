##### Abstract

Bioacoustic monitoring allows for simultaneous recording of the soundscape on large geographical and temporal scales. In this study, we explored the efficacy of pairing bioacoustics with deep learning and soundscape analysis methods by detecting elephant and bird sounds in Panti Forest Reserve. We calculated the soundscape indices of the recordings to elucidate the sound diversity which may reflect the level of biodiversity. The Panti Forest Reserve is surrounded by towns, private lands, plantations, and farmlands. Six automated bioacoustic recording devices were deployed at seven sites to record 24-hour wildlife vocal activity (31 days from 25 August to 25 September 2022). Recordings of 1 minute every 10 minutes were extracted to manually annotate elephant and bird sounds and to calculate soundscape indices. Elephant signs (i.e. dung or footprints) were recorded in three sites and elephant sounds were found in one site. Elephant sounds and forest sounds (non-elephant sounds) collected were added to an existing Convolutional Neural Network model and achieved 95.98% average training accuracy and 97.31% average test accuracy. From the sound recordings, we were able to identify 35 species of birds, of which seven are near-threatened. In addition, our soundscape indices showed that the daytime activity showed more fluctuation than nocturnal activity. Panti Forest Reserve remains rich in the diversity of animal sounds and is a fertile ground for bioacoustic research. We hope that in future, the application of bioacoustics can support in minimising dangerous human-elephant encounter and elephant-vehicle collisions especially around the edge of forest reserves, wildlife ecological corridors and agriculture areas.
